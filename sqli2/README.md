Drats. My friends found out that I obtained unauthorised access to the chat page and upgraded the security of the page. The new page now resides at http://ctf101-347181178.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com:3009 and it authenticates a user using a number between 0 to 9999. A hacker friend of mine told me that the numbers are stored in plain in a table called 'users' with columns 'username' and 'password' but he doesn't want to tell me the numbers. Can you help me to stealthily gain access to the system again?
